## Interview Practice
In preparation for interviews, I am building a repository for all my [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) submissions.

## Languages
I plan to use multiple languages. Primarily in case certain companies require (or prefer) certain languages, I would have the requisite practice. Some of the language I plan to code in are
- Java
- Javascript
- Python
- Typescript
And database questions I'd image are all in SQL
